    <h3 class="subHead">Computer Science and Engineering Student at UC Merced:<br><br>2015-Present</h3>
    
    <p>I am currently a Computer Science and Engineering Student at UC Merced going into my last year. Over the course of my schooling I have developed my programming skills with many languages:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>With these skills, I hope to be an exemplary web designer or video game designer. In order to sharpen these skills I have worked on a series of side projects in game design and web development.
    
    <br><br>Beyond programming, my particular degree also includes engineering. I believe that interdisciplinary skill is important, and knowing how things work behind the scenes is crucial to making a robust product. I am proud of the skills and experiences I have developed at UC Merced

    <h3 class="subHead">Merced Vernal Pools and Grassland Reserve Intern:<br><br>2017-present
</h3>
    
    <p>I currently work as an intern for the UC Merced Vernal Pools and Grassland Reserve, or MVPGR for short. The MVPGR is part of the UC Natural Reserve system which includes 36 other reserves scattered throughout the state. Our reserve is particularly unique because it is one of the only reserves directly adjacent to campus.
        <br><br>
    As the MVPGR intern my duties included updating species lists, assisting in research, maintaining our website, and leading excursions on the reserve for the public. Since I have been the intern, the amount of public outings to expose the community of Merced to our reserve has doubled.

    <h3 class="subHead">Communications Officer, Unmanned Aerial Services Team:
    <br><br>
    2017-2018
    </h3>
    
    
    <p>I was a member of the Unmanned Aerial Services Engineering Service Learning Team at UC Merced. We were working on developing a system what detect water stress in grape crops. In Californiaâ€™s San Juaquin Valley, water is a precious resource. Our system would positively effect the water depravity in the community around our school by allowing for farmers to more accurately assess and treat their plants.
    <br><br>
    For both semesters that I participated in the project, I assumed a leadership role as the Communications Officer. As Communication Officer, my responsibilities included the scheduling of all upcoming meetings, liaison with our community partners,  and creating detailed weekly status updates.
    <br><br>
    In addition to my leadership role, I was also a member of the Imaging Team. Our team was tasked with engineering the software that would stitch many images together and assess water stress. To stitch the images we used the free software Microsoft ICE. We decided on this because we wanted are system to be effective and inexpensive to be more accessible to a wider variety of farmers. To detect water stress, we overlaid two images gathered with our drone. One of the photos would be taken with a standard RBG (Red Green Blue) camera, and the other would be taken with an IR (Infra-Red) camera. With these images would could use an algorithm called NDVI that would identify water stress in plants by analysing the reflectivity of the leaves.

    <h3 class="subHead">Ocean Lifeguard:
    <br><br>
    2013-2019
    </h3>
    
    <p>I spent 6 years as a Seasonal Ocean Lifeguard for the Laguna Beach Department of Marine Safety. The hiring process for this job was brutally difficult and it helped me develop an appreciation for hard work. Starting in the cold month of February, cadets must undergo a series of competitive swims and races which were immediately followed by tough classroom tests. After the initial test in February, cadets are inducted into an academy that meets for 8 hours every Saturday and Sunday for 4 weeks. Throughout the academy, cadets are scored physical, practical, and classroom test. Then at the end of the training, rookies will be hired starting form the top of the list and only going until all vacancies are filled.
    <br><br>
    Beyond the satisfaction of the hard work, Lifeguarding also taught me how to have strong public speaking skills. Part of the job requires you to not be afraid to talk to any stranger on the beach and sometimes the things you say are not what they want to hear. The City of Laguna Beach is only seven miles long, but hosts more than 2 million tourists every summer.
    <br><br>
    As an Ocean Lifeguard, I was very successful. I received the prestigious Rookie Lifeguard of the Year award and consistently worked the more difficult beaches that required not only fitness and water skill, but deft people skills.
